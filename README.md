# InTune-Mount-Network-Drives-MacOS
This script was designed to map a network drive and set the workgroup path in Word to the network location so that devices would get the Office Templates path mapped without having to log a ticket of contact ICT. This script also enables mapping of any network drives via SMB on MacOS with this script designed to be deployed through InTune.
